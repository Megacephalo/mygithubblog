What a heck of a ride for me throughout the last six or seven years-ish on a Quixote's journey to build my own autonomous rover. I am aiming to understand and be able to build my own self-driving robots with the latest technology available at this time. But why? Because I want to design and make robots that save lives and can make future driving more enjoyable and, most importantly, safe, for everyone.

But what is the importance for you to be here reading all these words? If you are a robot enthuasiast as I am and want to embark on this journey to build your own robot with a substantial understanding on the algorithm and software behind it, here is the right place for you, my friend. Without further due, let's jump right in.
